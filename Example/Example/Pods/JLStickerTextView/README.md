##Features

* set the Color, alpha, font, alignment of the text
* StickerTextView also handle the process of rendering text on Image

##Installation
###CocoaPods
To integrate StickerTextView into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile and run `pod install`:

```Ruby
use_frameworks!
pod "JLStickerTextView", "~> 0.1.1"
```

###Manually
Just drag the Source files into your project

##Usage
###Start
First, import `JLStickerTextView`, then subclass the UIImageView, which you want to add text on, to JLStickerImageView, like this:

```Swift
import JLStickerTextView
class ViewController: UIViewController {
	@IBOutlet var stickerView: JLStickerImageView!
}
```

If you use Storyboard, you also need connect the UIImageView to `JLStikcerImageView` Class in Identity Inspector.

###Add new Label
It is quite easy to add new label to current StickerImageView:
```Swift
stickerView.addLabel()
```

###set the Label
You can set the color, font , alignment and alpha of the label
####Color
```Swift
stickerView.textColor = UIColor.whiteColor()
```
####Alpha
```Swift
sticker.textAlpha = CGFloat(textAlpha)
```
####Font
```Swift
stickerView.fontName = fontName
```

####Alignment

```
stickerView.textAlignment = NSTextAlignment.Center
```

**Note**: when you set the properties, you make change to the current selected TextLabel.

###Render Text on Image
When you feel good, you are going to render the Text on Image and save the image:

```Swift
let image = stickerView.renderTextOnView(stickerView)
UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum(image!, nil, nil, nil)
```

###Scale stickerView  proportionally
This function is not complete yet, I just make it to fit my requirement.

```
stickerView.limitImageViewToSuperView()
```

When you render the text on UIImageView whose content mode is AspectFit, it is possible you will get some unwanted border. This function will scale UIImageView to fit the image. 

##Plan
Here are some ideas:

* more options for text(eg: lineSpacing)
* interface to custome the appearance of StickerLabelView(close Button, rotate button, border,etc)
* more general solution for Scaling stickerView proportionally
* add placeholder
